        <h1 class="title">First Hokage - Hashirama Senju</h1>
        <p class="text">Hashirama Senju (千手柱間, Senju Hashirama) was a member
            of the famed Senju clan. He himself was hailed as the
              "God of Shinobi" for his unmatched ninja prowess.
               Hashirama sought peace for the shinobi world, and
                to that end founded Konohagakure with his clan, 
                his childhood friend and rival: Madara Uchiha and
                 the Uchiha clan. He would later become the First 
                 Hokage (初代火影, Shodai Hokage, literally meaning: 
                 First or Founding Fire Shadow) of Konohagakure. 
                 Although he was not able to achieve peace during his lifetime,
                 his legacy and vision for the world would continue to shape the village and the entire shinobi world even after his death.</p>

            <p class="note1">Hashirama Senju was known to be the strongest of his era and the only one who could give him a proper
                 fight was none other than Madara Uchiha. With his powers, Hashirama was several levels above everyone
                  else and thus, people held him in great regard.
                    His powers had made him the only second person to gain the title of "God of Shinobi" after Hagoromo Otsutsuki,
                     with Hiruzen Sarutobi being the third and the last one.</p>

            <p class="note2">Hashirama Senju's power came from the mighty Wood Release Kekkei Genkai. 
                This ability was something that only he possessed since birth. After him, 
                no other shinobi in the Naruto series was seen wielding it through natural means.
                As the name suggests, it allowed him to create and manipulate vegetation and use it to full effect in battle.
                 It was strong enough to completely change the surroundings into forests at full power.</p>
